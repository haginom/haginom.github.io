            <p>My name is Saki. Welcome to my Founders & Coders application. I made this website to show you who I am and to showcase some of the technical skills I've picked up along the way! Enjoy!</p>

                        <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

                        <p>My logic skills are good and as I started learning code with C, I feel I have a strong foundation in the basics. The value of that foundation was made really clear to me as I began to work through the prerequisites. I felt that I knew how to approach the kata challenges without google!
                        <br><br>I have very good interpersonal skills, ie teamwork and communication. These skills are often overlooked, but I think they are a critical aspect to any good productive team and in particular, within peer-led teaching. I enjoy working with people, I’m curious to get to know them and work with them. I think teams need plenty of people with empathy, as it helps to create feelings of emotional safety in groups and a more free flowing and productive discussion.                        </p>

                        <p>Why coding? I like coding, I enjoy the puzzles and the satisfaction of the gotcha moments, I also love the fact that I can build something from scratch! In the longer term, I think it’s an amazing skill that could provide someone the skills to earn a living. I think that being involved in projects that teach code in the future would give me  an enormous sense of purpose. <br>
                            <br>Why Founders & Coders? I really like coding, clearly, and I’m quite happy with the progress I’m making through self-learning. So I’d be really excited to join a community of coders because I think it will be more fun as well as a really important experience to solve problems together. I think Founders & Coders as an organisation is a good match for me…
