            <p>My name is Saki. Welcome to my Founders & Coders application. I made this website to show you who I am and to showcase some of the technical skills I've picked up along the way! Enjoy!</p>

                        <p>Why coding? I like coding, I enjoy the puzzles and the satisfaction of the gotcha moments, I also love the fact that I can build something from scratch! In the longer term, I think it’s an amazing skill that could provide someone the skills to earn a living. I think that being involved in projects that teach code in the future would give me  an enormous sense of purpose. <br>
                        <br>Why Founders & Coders? I really like coding, clearly, and I’m quite happy with the progress I’m making through self-learning. So I’d be really excited to join a community of coders because I think it will be more fun as well as a really important experience to solve problems together. I think Founders & Coders as an organisation is a good match for me…
