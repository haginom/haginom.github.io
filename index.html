                        <p>
                            Hello, I‚Äôm Saki. I built this site to show some of the skills I have learnt in HTML, CSS and Javascript and to tell you a bit about myself. So here is a brief introduction.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I spent 10+ years on China: either research, working in/with or living in. During this time I worked on projects related to politics, human rights, climate change and international governance.  
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           Now, and over the last 9-10 months, I have been learning how to code. Through the Harvard CS50 course, I learnt basic programming concepts and now have a good foundation in computational thinking. In the future, I hope that coding will give me the tools to work on projects that have a direct social impact. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            
                <div>
                    <label for='toggle-what' class='checkbox'>What do I have to offer? +</label>
                    <input class='box-collapsible' id='toggle-what' type='checkbox'>
                    <div class="collapsible-content">
                        <p>
                            Putting the code aside briefly, I can contribute towards the 2021 Spring cohort working well together with:
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> 
                            Good old teamwork: In my work I've helped facilitate, mediate and encourage free-flowing intercultural dialogue. I'm friendly, helpful, and genuinely curious about people so that seemed to add to a good productive environment where everyone felt safe and confident to express their opinions.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            And... communication: Important in a peer-led learning environment, I'm good at expressing myself clearly and am eager to help people. This should help if I need to take part in teaching and explaining things I understand.

                        <p>
                            I have made quite a drastic change in my career direction in the last year, so why? 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I have two basic motivations in my work, I want to be challenged and I want to be involved in projects that have a social impact. However I felt that the path I had taken was not the best to allow me to work on projects that have a direct social impact. So I changed. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I got hooked on programming after taking David Malan's CS50 course. I loved the type of challenges and the satisfaction of solving a problem. 
                        </p>    
                        <br>
                        <p>
                         Over the last few months, I‚Äôve been experimenting with building front-end of websites and I love I can build something from scratch. It‚Äôs quite an empowering tool, in that it gives you the skill to earn a living or create a product or bring your ideas to life. So being involved in projects that teach code in the future would also be hugely rewarding.

                        Since early 2020, I have been learning to code - whilst working in a Japanese cafe making onigiri (rice-balls) to help support myself. I did the CS50 course, a python course (basic) on coursera as well as completing all the requirements for this course.

                        <p>In London, I worked as a Project Manager for the Great Britain China Center and the House of Commons in a dual role. I learnt a lot about intercultural dialogue in this role.
                            I organised meetings between UK and Chinese politicians, policy makers and practitioners on topics such as international governance, criminal justice, climate change and development.

                    <p>I read and wrote an awful lot during my Masters degree. And it prepared me not to feel overwhelmed by hundreds of pages of text (or code!). I can use the same skills to quickly analyze, dissect and prioritise what I'm reading. 
                        I also learnt how to set something out logically. Writing essays (and code) require logical ordering and good structure.
                        So in short, my masters has really prepared me to think about how to write clean code!

                    <p>SOAS helped to form a lot of my thoughts and beliefs. I was exposed to how to think about Europe from a different perspective. I began my long journey of learning Chinese, which requires a lot of self-motivation and perserverance. Both skills I have heard is necessary for coding!</p>
